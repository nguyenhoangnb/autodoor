# Motion Detection with PIR Sensor

- Write a program to read the output of the PIR sensor.
- When motion is detected, the PIR sensor will output a signal. This signal activates the RFID reader.

# RFID Card Authentication

- Develop a program to interface with the MFRC522 RFID reader for reading RFID cards.
- Store the RFID card IDs that are allowed to open the door within the program.

# Door Opening Mechanism

- Upon detecting a valid RFID card, send a signal to activate the door opening mechanism.
- The door opening mechanism involves the use of two motors to open the door.
